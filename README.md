# Advent of Code 2018

This repo contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2018](https://adventofcode.com/2018) problems.

### Directory structure

I'll be adding a directory for each day `1..25` and storing inside:

1. The Problem Descriptions
2. The Problem Inputs (if any)
3. A directory for each language
    * and maybe a `.gitignore` or other supporting material for running that language

### Approach to problems
My general approach is to solve the problem in [a boring language](https://developer.mozilla.org/bm/docs/Web/JavaScript) (to serve as pseudocode to make sure I actually understand the problem), I'll submit the solution to get some stars, and then I'll port/rewrite it into a more interesting language.
